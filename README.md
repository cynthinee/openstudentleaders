Mobilizing student leaders to promote open.

Hello! Welcome to the Open Student Leaders project. 

Thank you for visiting the Open Student Leaders repository. This project stems from the need to bring conversations and policies around open to college and university campuses, empowering students to learn about and lead open initiatives. 

Project description:

Write a project description: what you’re doing, with who, for who, and why. Sound familiar? This is a version of your project vision. Expand your sentence as a full paragraph, adding any new details about aims and the problems you plan to solve that surfaced in the Open Canvas activity. Try to phrase this so it’s understandable and appealing to a wide variety of people, not just those in your field.

Explain what makes your project special, useful, exciting! You can use the ideas you generated for “Unique Value Proposition” in your Open Canvas here.

Getting started:

Show how to get started using or contributing to the project. If you’re just getting started, this could be as simple as asking people to attend a planning call or kick-off event, or sign up for an email newsletter about the project. If you’re not sure quite how to get users involved just yet, don’t worry! In the next module, you’ll devise some ways for newcomers to get involved, and create contributor guidelines. Once you’ve done the next module, and you can come back to this README and add a link to contributor guidelines to this section.

Required resources:

State what resources are most needed. If you have a need for a special kind of help, expertise, or a resource like event space, be sure to mention that here.

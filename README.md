Mobilizing student leaders to promote open.

# Welcome!
Hello! Welcome to the Open Student Leaders project. 

Thank you for visiting the Open Student Leaders repository. This project stems from the need to bring conversations and policies around open to college and university campuses, empowering students to learn about and lead open initiatives. 

## What we're doing:

We are a student-led initiative at East Los Angeles College, a two-year community college in Southern California. While there are open projects happening in pockets around our campus, these conversations haven't been happening at an institutional level. We see open initiatives as solutions to inequity in information and inequity in educational opportunity. 

[Phase One: Institutionalizing OER](https://github.com/cynthinee/openstudentleaders/wiki/Phase-One:-Institutionalizing-OER)

At our college, this manifests in several ways. Most visibly, the cost of education today is exorbitant. Students struggle to pay for tuition even with fee waivers, and are then expected to pay hundreds of dollars on textbooks each semester. Thus, students who are unable to afford textbooks are at a deficit in their courses. Reducing the cost of required materials through open educational resources (OER) and open textbooks would benefit student success initiatives on campus.

Elements of Phase One include:

 * Reach out to student government to collaborate in the support of OER and open textbooks specifically 
 * Draft a student government senate resolution supporting the institutionalization of OER, including the promotion of, support for, and incentivization for faculty to use open textbooks.
 * Create and host student workshops on OER 
 * Recruit students to Phase Two student-led open projects

Secondly, we see inequity in access to information at both the institutional and community level. As a community college, we have less funding allocated to library database subscriptions and therefore have less access to scholarly materials. Supporting open access publishing would allow us to have access to more quality scholarly content that we would otherwise be unable to afford. Our institution is also represented by low-income communities of color, in which access to information is often inaccessible. 

**The four areas around openness that our project will involve are:**

* Open access (OA): "the free, immediate, online availability of research articles coupled with the rights to use these articles fully in the digital environment" -[SPARC](https://sparcopen.org/open-access/)

* Open education and open educational resources (OER): "Open Education encompasses resources, tools and practices that are free of legal, financial and technical barriers and can be fully used, shared and adapted in the digital environment. Open Education maximizes the power of the Internet to make education more affordable, accessible and effective" -[SPARC](https://sparcopen.org/open-education/)

* Open data: "is research data that is freely available on the internet permitting any user to download, copy, analyse, re-process, pass to software or use for any other purpose without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself" -[SPARC](https://sparcopen.org/open-data/)

* Open science: "is the practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are freely available, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods" -[FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/foster-taxonomy/open-science-definition)

Elements of Phase Two include:

* Recruit students to an Information Activism club, in which students identify open projects and work individually or in groups to execute these projects within the semester or academic year (including students from Phase One)
* Create and host workshops on open to students and student groups 
* Draft a student group charter with a collective mission and vision 
* Identify student interests and create subgroups around the four areas of openness 
* Identify faculty and community mentors to work with individual or group projects 
* Identify a regular in-person meeting time to host Information Activism student club meetings
* Identify and create an online space in which students can do this work and host their projects
* Faciliate individual and group projects over the semester and/or academic year 
* Present and publish at conferences and open access journals to showcase the strength in student-led open initiatives 

**Getting started:**

TBD.
